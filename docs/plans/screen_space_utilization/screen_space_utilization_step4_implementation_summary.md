## Stage 1 – Expand container width on large screens
- Changes: Increased the max-width for the main page container at large breakpoints.
- Verification: Manual smoke test suggested (view the dashboard on a wide screen and confirm the container grows; not run here).
- Notes: None.

## Stage 2 – Tighten vertical spacing for large screens
- Changes: Reduced minimum card heights at large breakpoints to trim unused vertical space.
- Verification: Manual smoke test suggested (compare card heights on wide viewports for reduced blank space; not run here).
- Notes: None.

## Stage 3 – Validate responsive behavior
- Changes: No code changes; confirmed that large-screen adjustments are scoped to wide breakpoints only.
- Verification: Manual smoke test suggested (check small and medium widths to ensure layout matches current behavior; not run here).
- Notes: None.
