## Stage 1 – Replace selector with floating toggle
- Changes: Removed the theme selector from headers and added a shared floating toggle button to both templates.
- Verification: Manual smoke test suggested (load both pages and confirm the toggle appears in the corner; not run here).
- Notes: None.
