## Stage 1 – Add a settings page shell
- Changes: Added `/settings` route and new `templates/settings.html` with a backup section plus navigation links from dashboard/manage pages.
- Verification: Not run here (requires loading `/settings` in a browser).
- Notes: Settings page uses shared styling and theme toggle.
