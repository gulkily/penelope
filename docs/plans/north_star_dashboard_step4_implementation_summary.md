## Stage 1 - Establish FastAPI app skeleton and static serving
- Changes: Added FastAPI app entrypoint, template rendering, and static file mounting; created base template and static placeholder.
- Verification: Started `uvicorn app.main:app` and fetched `/` successfully.
- Notes: Static and template directories are in place for later stages.
