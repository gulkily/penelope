## Stage 1 – Confetti module scaffold
- Changes: Added `static/js/confetti.js` with a small init + trigger API, reduced-motion detection, and cooldown-controlled bursts.
- Verification: Not run (needs manual browser load to confirm module initializes without console errors).
- Notes: Uses a global `window.NorthStarConfetti` to integrate with existing non-module scripts.
