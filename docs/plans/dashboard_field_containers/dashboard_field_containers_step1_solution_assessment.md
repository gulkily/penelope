# Dashboard Field Containers - Step 1 Solution Assessment

Problem statement: Key top-level fields (Project, North Star Objective, Questions) lack the same container styling used by the Summary/Challenges/Opportunities/Milestones cards, making the page feel visually inconsistent.

Option A: Wrap each target field in the existing card component
- Pros: Maximum consistency with existing sections, minimal new styling, easy to scan.
- Cons: May add vertical density and reduce top-of-page compactness.

Option B: Create a lighter “panel” variant for top-level fields
- Pros: Preserves hierarchy while aligning visual language, allows smaller spacing.
- Cons: Adds a new styling variant to maintain.

Option C: Convert the entire top area into a unified header card
- Pros: Strong visual grouping, clear primary context area.
- Cons: Larger layout change, higher risk of crowding on smaller screens.

Recommendation: Option A, because it reuses the established card component to quickly align visual consistency with minimal design risk.
