# Project Management (Add/Archive) - Step 1 Solution Assessment

Problem statement: Provide a separate page to add and archive projects while keeping the dashboard focused on progress tracking.

Option A - Management page with table + archive checkboxes + add form
- Pros: Matches the requested workflow; clear, efficient bulk updates.
- Cons: Needs careful UX for bulk changes and save behavior.

Option B - Combined page with tabs for Active and Archived
- Pros: Easy to switch views; keeps all management in one place.
- Cons: Slightly more UI/state handling.

Option C - Modal or drawer from the dashboard
- Pros: Stays in context; less navigation.
- Cons: Conflicts with the request for a separate page; adds overlay complexity.

Recommendation: Option A. It directly matches the requirement for a table with archive checkboxes plus an add project form.
