## Stage 1 – Establish E2E tooling baseline
- Changes: Added Playwright configuration, scripts, and a basic smoke test; updated gitignore for Playwright artifacts.
- Verification: Manual smoke test suggested (start the app and run `npm run test:e2e`; not run here).
- Notes: Tests expect the app to be running locally.
