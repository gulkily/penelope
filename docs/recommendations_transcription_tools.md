# In-Person Recording + Transcription Recommendations

## Suggested tools
- Otter.ai (mobile app or web): quick setup, live transcription, easy export.
- Zoom (local recording + cloud transcription): reliable if you already use Zoom.
- iOS Voice Memos or Android Recorder + Whisper transcription: highest control,
  but requires a manual transcription step.

## Quick usage notes
- Otter.ai: start a new recording on your phone, place it near the speakers,
  export the transcript when done.
- Zoom: start a local recording on a laptop with a USB mic, then download the
  transcript from the Zoom web portal.
- Voice Memos + Whisper: record with a phone or laptop, transcribe with Whisper
  (OpenAI API or a local tool), then paste the transcript.

## Workflow fit
- All options result in a plain transcript that can be pasted into the
  "Paste transcript" dialog for LLM processing.

## Privacy reminder
- Get consent to record and store transcripts in accordance with your program
  policies.
